### Problem

A menu is created through which:

1. Create a list of students identified by (name, year, 10 courses and 10 grades for each student, and the average corresponding to each student).
2. The list of students with all the data corresponding to each student is displayed.
3. Calculate the general average of each student (display name and average).
4. Students are displayed in descending order of average. Students with the same average are sorted alphabetically (display name + average + year).
5. All students from year 3 are displayed who have an average over 8.00 (name + year + average).
6. Insert a student's data (read from the keyboard) after the k-th(position in the list) student. If there are no k students it will be inserted at the beginning
or at the end of the list (user choice).
7. Remove all non-promoted students (average below 5.00) from the list.
8. Exit
